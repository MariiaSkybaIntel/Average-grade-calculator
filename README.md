<b>Average grade calculator</b>

This calculator automatically calculates the average grade for each person in the table when a grade is given,
however the average can also be calculated by clicking the button below the table.<br>
If an assignment is unsubmitted - the cell color changes to yellow.<br>
If average grade is < 40% the Final Grade cell color changes to red.<br>
If an invalid (non-digit) character is entered in editable cells the input is not reflected in the table.<br>
The second table calculates how many assignments are due for each person listed in the table.<br>
