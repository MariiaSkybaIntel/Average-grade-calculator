Description: Average grade calculator. 

Average grade is calculated automatically when a grade is given, however it can be also calculated using the button below the table.<br>
If an assignment is unsubmitted - the color cell changes to yellow.<br>
If average grade is < 40% the Final Grade cell color changes to red.<br>
If any non-digit character is entered in editable cells the input is not reflected in the table.<br>
The second table calculates how many assignments are due for each of the students.<br>
